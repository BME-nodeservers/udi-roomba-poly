### Adding Vacuums
For each vacuum, a configuration item needs to be added to the Polyglot Node Server configuration:
 *  Follow instructions here for obtaining roomba blid and password needed for configuration: https://github.com/NickWaterton/Roomba980-Python
 *  Use a key starting with "vacuum" (e.g. vacuum1, vacuum2, etc...) or "roomba" (e.g. roomba1, roomba2, etc...)
 *  Key value format: {"ip":"192.168.3.36", "blid":"6945841021309640","password":":1:1512838259:R0dzOYDrIVQHJFcR","name":"Upstairs Roomba"}  Note the use of double quotes
